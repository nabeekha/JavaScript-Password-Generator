# <Password Generator Application>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This project was built to utilize JavaScript to create backend functionality in websites. By creating this, I am able to improve my understanding of how a front-end website speaks to a backend server. This project creates a password generator, and thus increases security for any websites I build in the future. My motivation was to improve security and learn more about JavaScript.
